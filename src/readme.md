Rules of Hangman

1. The host shall think of a word, and write empty dashes and inform the player of how many characters there is.
2. The player shall guess a letter, each time it's a correct letter, it is added to the orgiginal word, otherwise it is added to a separate row of incorrect words.
3. The player only gets 6 chances, if the chances are exceeded then the player loses => Each time the player guesses an incorrect letter, an additional part of the 'hangman' is added until the hangman is 'hanged'
